The onset of depressive symptoms in those with manifest vascular disease may be the result of vascular pathology, but it is also possible that the diagnosis of a pernicious chronic disease per se and its impact on quality of life induces depressed mood.\n",

Stratification and terrigenous deposition increased further at the onset and within the earliest CIE which, coupled with evidence for sea level rise, may be interpreted as resulting from an increase in precipitation over NW Europe consistent with an enhanced hydrologic cycle in response to global warming during the PETM.\n",

      "The PETM was a period of geologically-rapid global warming that punctuated a warming Eocene climate 55.8Ma ago (Charles et al., 2011), and saw sea surface temperatures rise by 5-8°C from background levels (Zachos et al., 2005; Sluijs et al., 2007).\n",

      "It was associated with a substantial injection of δ13C-depleted carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (see Pagani et al., 2006a) over <20ka (Cui et al., 2011), causing a negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) between -2 and -7‰ in marine and terrestrial sediments (see overview in Schouten et al., 2007) lasting 170ka (Röhl et al., 2007), and a prominent dissolution horizon in the deep sea signifying deep ocean acidification (Kennett and Stott 1991; Zachos et al., 2005). The source and rate of released carbon are still under debate (Pagani et al., 2006a; Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011), but may have been linked to the dissociation of marine hydrates containing biogenic methane (δ13C of<-60‰) (Dickens et al., 1995), thermogenic methane from marine sediments around the Norwegian Sea (Svensen et al., 2004), or dissolved methane from a silled Kilda Basin between Greenland and Norway (Nisbet et al., 2009). The PETM may be a good analogue to test modelling studies that suggest current global warming trends may result in an enhanced hydrologic cycle (Seager et al., 2010), whereby increased precipitation in temperate rain belts is coupled with increased evaporation in lower latitudes.\n",

      "Modelling studies of the PETM have further indicated the potential importance of an increased hydrologic cycle (Lunt et al., 2010; Bice and Marotzke 2002), which could have altered ocean circulation causing methane hydrate reservoirs to destabilise, triggering massive carbon release (Bice and Marotzke, 2002). Palynological evidence from Arctic Spitsbergen (Harding et al., 2011) and New Zealand (Crouch et al., 2003a) suggests increased terrestrial runoff occurred at the onset of the CIE which may be related to hydrologic changes, and massive Pyrenees conglomerate deposits have been interpreted as the result of an abrupt increase in extreme precipitation within the early CIE (Schmitz and Pujalte, 2007). In addition, hydrogen and carbon isotope measurements of terrestrial plant and aquatic-derived n-alkanes from the central Arctic Ocean indicate that the core of the PETM was associated with increased precipitation and hence hydrologic cycle (Pagani et al., 2006b), although the onset of PETM warming was not recovered in the sediment core.\n",

Biome changes in response to modern global warming have been observed, but approaches to predict the vulnerability of ecosystems to future changes are still in development (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Vegetation shifts during the rapid warming associated with the PETM may provide a useful analogue to future biome responses.\n",

      "Whilst neotropical vegetation in Central America appears to have responded to warming during the PETM with increased diversity and origination rates (Jaramillo et al., 2010), central North America experienced a rapid migration of plant communities associated with lower precipitation at the onset of the CIE (Wing et al., 2005), and southern England may have experienced a major change in plant composition due to changes in local fire-regime (Collinson et al., 2009). To better understand biome responses to climatic change during the PETM, further high resolution vegetation cover studies are needed, specifically from temperate and boreal forests which may be amongst the most vulnerable ecosystems to global warming (Gonzalez et al., 2010).

This core is located in a critical region proximal to the NAIP, as there are currently no high resolution records of environmental change during the PETM from the North Sea Basin. Furthermore, as overturning of a stratified Kilda Basin at the CIE onset is hypothesised as a possible trigger for dissolved methane release to the atmosphere (Nisbet et al., 2009), analysing the stratification history of the nearby North Sea is a possible way to test this hypothesis.\n",

Biogenic silicon cycling is inextricably linked to both long and short term carbon cycling through the diatoms, siliceous walled autotrophs which today account for up to 40% of primary production. It is hypothesised that during the Late Eocene a sharp rise in diatom abundance could have contributed to pCO2 drawdown and global cooling by increasing the proportion of organic carbon buried in marine sediment.\n",

Among the phytoplankton, diatoms are notably important for the export and burial of organic carbon for a number of reasons. Firstly, diatoms efficiently export carbon from the surface ocean: their silica frustules provide ballast material, they are relatively large cells at the base of short food webs, and they form blooms that can terminate in aggregation and mass settling of cells (Baines et al., 2010; Buesseler, 1998; Ragueneau et al., 2000; Smetacek, 1999).\n",

Diatom domination of the resident phytoplankton community makes them critical in determining the magnitude of the CO2 flux to the atmosphere and the efficiency of the biological pump (Marinov et al., 2006; Sarmiento et al., 2004).\n",

These upwelled waters are advected northwards by Ekman transport and thus provide nutrients that fuel diatom (as well as other phytoplankton) production, creating marked bands of opal and carbon export (Fig.\n",

The late Eocene witnessed both a second diatom proliferation, culminating in an explosion of species diversity (Rabosky and Sorhannus, 2009) and enhanced Southern Ocean biogenic opal burial (Salamy and Zachos, 1999; Schumacher and Lazarus, 2004).\n",

Over millions of years, processes such as organic carbon burial, which control the size of the surficial carbon reservoir, are likely to be of greater importance to atmospheric pCO2 than mechanisms such as ocean circulation or biological mediation of the deep ocean carbon reservoir, which largely alter the partitioning of this surficial carbon between the ocean and atmospheric reservoirs (Berner, 2003).\n",

      "The Osi profile at Portland suggests that the restriction of the epeiric WIS during the pre-OAE 2 interval amplified the affects of high weathering rates as abundant organic-rich sediments sequestered radiogenic Os derived from the ancient continental crust. The close similarity of Osi profiles from ∼50 kyr prior to the OAE 2 and throughout the syn-OAE 2 interval indicates that transgression progressed to a point where a homogeneous global seawater signal was delivered to multiple proto-transatlantic basins by active ocean circulation. Furthermore, the synchronicity of the unradiogenic Osi pattern suggests that the magnitude of Caribbean LIP volcanism was sufficient to simultaneously influence the seawater chemistry of each basin; the abundance of organic-rich sediments added to the water column as a result of enhanced continental weathering permitted sequestration of hydrogenous unradiogenic Os from the contemporaneous Caribbean LIP.\n",

However, limestone is a naturally-occurring material, and always contains other species in the form of trace elements. The high temperature conditions under which carbonation and calcination occur, present opportunities for trace elements to be released to the environment, thereby representing a potential source of environmental contamination, in addition to that produced from coal combustion.\n",

      "Enceladus, one out of currently 62 satellites of Saturn, orbits the planet at a distance of 3.95 Saturn radii RS (1RS=60,268km) and is embedded in the radiation belts of Saturn's inner magnetosphere. Even with a small radius REnc of only 252km and an apparent similarity to other icy moons, this moon is by far the most important internal source of dust, neutral gas and plasma in the saturnian system and especially in the magnetosphere. As already inferred from data of the first flybys of the Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager 1 (1980) and Voyager 2 (1981) spacecraft, respectively (Smith et al., 1981; Krimigis et al., 1982), this moon plays the same role Io does for the jovian system.\n",

Directly measured charged dust would require that the dust grains entering the low-energy aperture of MIMI/LEMMS are bent in the internal magnetic field towards the electron detector E. Assuming a bend radius of about 1cm with a 800 G internal magnetic field the mass of a singly charged dust grain cannot be higher than 4.3amu which is much lighter than those dust particles measured by the dust instrument CDA and therefore cannot account for the correlation between the peaks in MIMI/LEMMS and CDA.\n",

This makes qualitative sense because Voyager IRIS observations of Uranus (Flasar et al., 1987) imply that winds generally decay with height, although the quantitative estimates for the 500-1000mb region are only 2-5m/s per scale height at 25-30°N.\n",

Magnetospheric forcing on Earth is controlled by the interaction between the solar wind and magnetosphere via the Dungey cycle (Dungey, 1961), while on Jupiter the planet's rotation represents the primary generator of electric fields and driver of magnetospheric currents which ultimately lead to auroral emissions and enhanced ionospheric Pedersen and Hall currents (e.g., Clarke et al., 2004, Cowley et al., 2004, Bougher et al., 2005).\n",
